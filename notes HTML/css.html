                Determines what out of padding and border is included in

                content-box: includes only content in width/height border-box:

                display<br />
                the display property sets an element's inner and outer display
                types. The outer type sets an element's participation in flow
                layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. block: The
                element generates a block element box, generating line breaks
                both before and after the element when in the normal flow.
                inline: The element generates one or more inline element boxes
                that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. In
                normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there
                is space. Margin and padding TOP/Bottom will not work. Only
                Margin Padding for left right will work. inline-block: The
                element generates a block element box that will be flowed with
                surrounding content as if it were a single inline box (behaving
                much like a replaced element would). none: Element is removed
                from the document flow. Turns off the display of an element so
                that it has no effect on layout (the document is rendered as
                though the element did not exist). </div

                text-align<br />sets the horizontal alignment of the content
                inside a block element or table-cell box. This means it works
                like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.

                position<br />The position CSS property sets how an element is
                positioned in a document. static: The element is positioned
                according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right,
                bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the
                default value. relative: The element is positioned according to
                the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to
                itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The
                offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus,
                the space given for the element in the page layout is the same
                as if position were static. absolute: The element is removed
                from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the
                element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its
                closest positioned non-static ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is
                placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final
                position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and
                left. fixed: The element is removed from the normal document
                flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
                layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing
                block established by the viewport sticky: The element is
                positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and
                then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and
                containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including
                table-related elements, based on the values of top, right,
                bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any
                other elements. </div

            <div class="topic">
                float<br />The float CSS property places an element on the left
                or right side of its container, allowing text and inline
                elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the
                normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the
                flow. </div

                clear<br />sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared)
                floating elements that precede it. The clear property applies to
                floating and non-floating elements. clearfix: If an element
                contains only floated elements, its height collapses to nothing.
                If you want it to always be able to resize, so that it contains
                floating elements inside it, you need to self-clear its
                children. This is called clearfix, and one way to do it is to
                add clear to a replaced ::after pseudo-element on it.
                #container::after { content: ""; display: block; clear: both; } </div

                flexbox<br />is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out
                items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space
                and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. width: set the width of
                child-element to 100% to fit it in the container and not
                overflow The parent element that has display: flex set on it is
                called the flex container. The items being laid out as flexible
                boxes inside the flex container are called flex items. Container
                Properties: flex-direction, justify-content, flex-wrap,
                align-items, align-content Flex-item Properties: order, flex,
                flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink, align-self Container
                Properties flex-direction: sets how flex items are placed in the
                flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal
                or reversed). (row-default, column, row/column-reverse)
                flex-wrap: sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or
                can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets
                the direction that lines are stacked justify-content:For main
                axis align-items: Cross axis align-content: manage space between
                rows in cross axis Flex-item Properties align-self: overrides a
                grid or flex item's align-items value. It aligns the item on the
                cross axis. flex-grow: Controls the rate of growth of
                flex-items. This property specifies how much of the remaining
                space in the flex container should be assigned to the item.
                flex-shrink: sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the
                size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items
                shrink to fit according to flex-shrink. flex-basis: Specifies
                the ideal size of a flex item BEFORE it's placed into a
                flex-container. If this min width is reached then a new line
                will be created. It sets the size of the content box unless
                otherwise set with box-sizing. Can be used to set different
                width of different flex-items. flex: Defines how a flex item
                will grow or shrink to fit the available space in a container.
                =flex-grow+shrink+basis order: Specifies the order used to lay
                out items in their flex container. sets the order to lay out an
                item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are
                sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code
                order. </div

                grid-template-rows: Defines the columns and rows of the grid
                with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the
                track size, and the space between them represents the grid

                column-gap row-gap<br />
                gap: Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it

                grid-auto-rows: specifies the size of an implicitly-created grid
